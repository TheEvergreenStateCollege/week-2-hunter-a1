        "\n",
        "To figure out which feature set to use, we can use cross validation. Since there are 52 features, in theory, we could consider $2^{52}$ different models. For the sake of simplicity, we'll consider only 52 models, where the $i$th model includes features 1 through $i$. For example, the 3rd model would include the first 3 features only (\"CRIM\", \"ZN\", and \"INDUS\").\n",
        "\n",
        "While using fewer features may increase our training error, it may also decrease our test error and help prevent overfitting to the training set.\n",
        "\n",
        "You might ask, why don't we just use the plot above to find $p$, the optimal number of features? In real life, you'd NEVER generate this plot. Using the test set more than once for any reason is not a good idea. Otherwise, you're effectively using the test data to fit your hyperparameters (in this case, N, the number of features).\n",
        "\n",
        "In the next section, we'll instead use $k$-fold cross-validation to select the best subset of features for our model. Recall the approach looks something like:\n",
        "\n",
        "<img src=\"https://github.com/TheEvergreenStateCollege/week-2-hunter-a1/blob/main/lab/lab10/cv.png?raw=1\" width=500px>\n",
        "\n",
        "**Warning**: The above questions are to illustrate some general differences we can see between train set and test set and the phenomenon on overfitting, however, we **should not use the test set at all when selecting models**. Instead, we should use cross-validation to select the feature set. When selecting features or choosing hyper-parameters, we can split the training set further into multiple train and validation sets (each split is called a \"fold\", hence k-fold cross validation). We will use the average validation error across all k folds to help select the optimal hyper-parameters and feature set.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Furthermore,** selecting the first $N$ features, in general, is not a good way to select features, since the order of our columns is relatively meaningless. We present this as an example for you here to illustrate the concept of cross validation. In future assignments, we will look at more robust methods for feature selection."
